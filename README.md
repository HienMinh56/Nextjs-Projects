# Selling drawing courses website

This is a front-end design project for a website selling drawing courses using ReactJS + Vite. This is our team's first product, so there will be a few errors and the interface may have some errors that haven't had a chance to be fixed, but in general, we have met most of the requirements of a normal sales website.

```bash
npm run dev (to run project)
npm install (to install dependencies)
```
